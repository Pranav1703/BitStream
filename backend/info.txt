torrent file and magnet links:-
When you download a torrent file directly, you are getting that .torrent file from the web server.

When you use a magnet link, the URL you clicked on is passed over to your torrent client, 
which uses the DHT P2P network to find other torrent clients with that file and download the .torrent file from them. 
The original web server only gave you the original URL, and isn't involved in you fetching that content.

So, magnet URLs have the advantage that they don't require the server to actually serve up the .torrent files, 
and they give an easy way for users to share links to torrents instead of having to share the entire .torrent file. 
The original web server can be years dead, yet the magnet URL can still keep working as long as there are users out there with that file.


Magnet Link → Finds peers and downloads .torrent file.
Torrent File → Guides the client to find and download the actual files.
